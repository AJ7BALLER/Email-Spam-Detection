# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or not spam. This is accomplished by analyzing various features extracted from email texts and utilizing machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 4,600 samples with 58 features each. The features are numerical and likely represent various attributes of the email content, such as word frequency, length, and other characteristics.

### Number of Samples: 4,600
### Number of Features: 58
# Installation
To run the project, you will need to have Python installed along with several Python libraries.

# Modeling
Various machine learning algorithms can be used for the classification task, such as:

### Logistic Regression
### Decision Trees
### Random Forest
### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

# Evaluation 
The models can be evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The performance of the model is evaluated using a separate test set. Key metrics include:

### Accuracy: 
Overall correctness of the model.
### Precision:
Correctness of positive predictions.
### Recall: 
Ability to find all positive samples.
### F1-Score: 
Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or find any issues, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
